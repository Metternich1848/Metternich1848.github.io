                    <p>Crowned as one of the greatest storytellers for kids of the 20th century, Roald Dahl was a world-renowned British author of novels on children's literature. Reading the masterpieces of Dahl is like experiencing a fairytale-like adventure. By the end of the adventurous journey, readers would learn a treasurable moral lesson from this insightful novelist. Among all the masterworks of this talented writer, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is undeniably the magnum opus of his entire collection. </p>

                    <p>Born in a poverty-stricken family, an eleven-year-old boy named Charlie Bucket was struggling in a rotten shack with his parents as well as his paternal and maternal grandparents. Charlie’s father was the only breadwinner of the family, but his small paycheck was only barely enough to make both ends meet. The whole family were all freezing under a cold weather without adequate food to eat except a limited amount of soup with cabbages. Just like any other youngsters in the city, the little Charlie was indulged in eating confectionery. Poor as he was, Charlie was fortunate enough to have a tiny bar of chocolate once a year on his birthday. </p>

                    <p>As a legendary chocolate manufacturer and triumphant entrepreneur, the elusive Willy Wonka owned the largest chocolate factory in history. In order to select a successor for his business, he published an advertisement in the newspaper declaring that if anyone could find one of the five Golden Tickets embedded in random chocolate bars, they would be allowed to take a mystical tour of the awe-inspiring candy factory and earn a lifetime supply of sweets. Charlie propitiously found the last Golden Ticket of the five. Alongside the other four spoiled kids from different parts of the world, Charlie was granted an access to the far-famed chocolate factory with his frail grandfather. </p>

                    <!--<h3>Do you deliver it as a gift?</h3>-->
                    <p>During their tour, all the children were mesmerized by all kinds of wonders and unconventional inventions, including a compelling chocolate waterfall, a three-course bubblegum, a workforce of nut-testing squirrels as well as a state-of-the-art teleportation device. Except for Charlie, the other four brats gave into their impetuous impulses and continuously ignored Mr. Wonka’s kindly advice, resulting in irreversible punishments for the rest of their lives. In contrast to the other urchins, Charlie conducted himself with obedience and respect throughout the visit, deeply impressing the factory owner. Finally, Wonka entrusted the kind-hearted Charlie to be the heir of his enterprise and invited all his family to live in the chocolate factory. </p>

                    <p>Growing up as an underprivileged kid, Charlie lost at the starting line from birth. But in the end, his kindness and selfless let him win the ownership of the flamboyant factory and take his family out of poverty. The young Charlie was a role model of what a good child should be. Although Charlie was widely regarded as the protagonist of the tale, Willy Wonka was the true leading character of the story.</p>

                    <p>Wonka was a whimsical chocolate maker who owned a colossal chocolate factory in the city. Described as a quirky businessman with peculiar personalities, Wonka was a sagacious capitalist with vision and passion. He was intelligent enough to invent a variety range of confectionery products which were sold like hot cakes in the market. Also, he was brave enough to explore an unknown frontier, Loompa Land, and hired the mysterious dwarfs named Oompa Loompas to help him run the business. Most importantly, Wonka orchestrated an outlandish tour to help him find the most qualified inheritor to inherit his legacy of creating enchanting candies. </p>

                    <p>Though written sixty years ago, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is still unquestionably one of the most influential adolescent fiction books in history. The story has been adapted into movies several times over the years, and now it has got a prequel film delving into the origins of the eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka and his bizarre chocolate factory. The movie “Wonka” has been released in Hong Kong on December 7th, 2023. May everyone enjoy the fantastic timeless tale of Willy Wonka during this Christmas. </p>
